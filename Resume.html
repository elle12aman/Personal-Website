            computational costs; learned that non-linear grids enhanced boundary
            layer resolution but introduced mild numerical oscillations;
            demonstrated that multi-block grids provided a balanced trade-off
            between accuracy and computational performance.

            optimized camber and thickness distributions.<br />
            &bull; Analyzed both compressible and incompressible flow behavior
            using Prandtl-Glauert corrections and thin airfoil theory to assess
            performance across subsonic and transonic regimes.<br />
            &bull; Redesigned lower surface profiles to offset shock-induced
            lift losses while maintaining a manufacturable trailing edge
            geometry.<br />
            &bull; Achieved full lift recovery post-shock, with the final design
            producing a compressible lift coefficient of 1.0842 at Mach 0.6353.
            Validated the final airfoil as a thin-profile geometry with optimal
            camber and angle of attack, confirming its aerodynamic efficiency
            for high-speed propeller use.
